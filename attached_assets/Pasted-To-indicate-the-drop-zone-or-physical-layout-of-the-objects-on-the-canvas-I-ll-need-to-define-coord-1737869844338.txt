To indicate the drop zone or physical layout of the objects on the canvas, I'll need to define coordinates or zones on the canvas where objects should be placed. These can be implemented programmatically as bounding boxes (areas where objects "snap into place") or as a grid system. 
Here how to organize it in a way that I can see what it looks like first then adjust as needed. 
 
1- Represent Layout Zones 
Each 'area' on the canvas can be represented by: 
- Coordinates: Define where each 'zone' or placement area exists on the canvas (e.g., x and y positions with width and height). 
Zone IDs: Assign a unique ID to each zone, which maps to an objects correct placement. 
Labels / Descriptions: Include a label to describe the area (e.g., "Application Services", Technical Services"). 
 
2- Data Structure for Zones 
You can define the zones in a table or on a separate admin portal where I can go in as an admin, and easily enter data and save it. This should be connected to the front end so that every save will appear in the front end. That way I donâ€™t have to ask you to develop new changes. Let's start with this table with the ability to insert additional rows.

Scenario Tables: 
This table links customers to their specific sets of zones and objects. We will have a registration feature so users can register with their email. If a user registers with their work email, then all users with the same work eamil can have access to the same specific game session details.
